DESCRIPTION

JSLint (www.JSLint.com) is a code quality tool for JavaScript that scans
JavaScript code for errors and potential improvements. JSLint is written in
JavaScript and a Rhino edition is available to run on the command line. This
script allows the Rhino edition to be run on node.js exactly as if it ran on
Rhino.


INSTALLATION

Just download the jslint.js file or clone the repository.


USAGE

node jslint.js [file to check]


GLOBAL COMMENTS

JSLint recognizes special comments in your files that tell it to ignore certain
globals when reporting unknown references. For instance, require, exports, and
process are node.js global variables that JSLint is unaware of. Putting this in
your files will tell JSLint to ignore these variables:

/*global require, exports, process */


CONFIGURATION COMMENTS

You can extensively customize JSLint with /*jslint */ comments. For more
information, see: 

http://www.JSLint.com/lint.html


IMPLEMENTATION

The incompatibility of the Rhino edition with node.js is simply because of
differences in builtin API between Rhino and node.js. The script is the
original Rhino edition script with a small shim inserted that translates the
node.js API into the Rhino API. Nothing else is changed.
